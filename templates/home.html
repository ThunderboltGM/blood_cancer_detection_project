        <h2>About This Project</h2>
        <p>This project aims to raise awareness about blood cancer through predictive analysis based on uploaded images.
            It utilizes Deep learning algorithms to provide insights and predictions about potential stages of blood
            cancer.</p>

        <h2>Libraries Used in This Project</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <h3>Flask Framework</h3>
                <p>Flask is a lightweight WSGI web application framework in Python. It is designed with simplicity and
                    flexibility in mind, making it easy to build web applications quickly and efficiently. In this
                    project, Flask is used to create the web interface and manage server-side logic.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>TensorFlow</h3>
                <p>TensorFlow is an open-source library developed by Google for numerical computation and machine
                    learning. It allows developers to build and train deep learning models, including sequential models
                    like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). In this project, TensorFlow is used to build and train a
                    sequential model for blood cancer prediction.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>OpenCV</h3>
                <p>OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is an open-source computer vision and machine learning
                    software library. OpenCV is used extensively for real-time image processing, and in this project, it
                    is employed for preprocessing images before they are fed into the CNN model.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Gemini LLM</h3>
                <p>The Gemini LLM is a pre-trained large language model that provides advanced natural language
                    processing capabilities. In this project, Gemini is used to generate text and insights based on
                    model predictions and other data inputs, enhancing the interpretability of the results.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>SQLite3</h3>
                <p>SQLite3 is a C-language library that provides a lightweight, disk-based database. It does not require
                    a separate server process, making it an ideal choice for small to medium-sized applications. In this
                    project, SQLite3 is used to manage the SQL database, storing user inputs, prediction results, and
                    other necessary data.</p>
